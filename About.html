<p align="center"><h1 align="center">Hello World!!!!</h1>I am John Lawrence Frecia, a Student in 
Adamson University taking Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. This paragraph will talk about myself. 
To start, I choose this program because this is what I wanted to be,I enjoy the lessons so much and 
I waited for this since I was a little child. I only excel in any of what Iâ€™m taking computer studies 
but I strive on whatever lesson I wanted to learn, but computer studies are the only 
exception this is really I wanted to be,it was fun to make a program and it can run.<br><br>
I also want to take this course because my dream was to make and play game always. I also want to share 
my passions to everyone and create a virtual world, where everyone can be happy and express their very own
 ideas and to explore the whole virtual world.
